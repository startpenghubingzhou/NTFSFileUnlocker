## What's it?

 This is a small tool for unlocking files in NTFS partitions.

If you are using some NTFS read-write tools such as Mounty on macOS, you may find that some files may be locked and display in gray when you restart your computer, which can't be opearated.

This tool will help you to solve this problem. Just drag your files and file dictionaries in the NTFS partition into the tool,  and it will unlock them automatically.
